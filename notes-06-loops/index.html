 <h1>Loops and Looping</h1>
 	<p>Loops allow you to iterate code by telling the computer/browser how many times it should run a certain block of code.</p>

 	<p>Loops are useful because they let you save time and allow you to write significantly less code.</p>

 	<p>There are three major types of loops</p>

 	<ul>
 		<li>For Loop</li>
 		<li>While Loop</li>
 		<li>Do While Loop</li>
 	</ul>

 	<p>Each of the above loops accomplish essentially the same thing; improving code efficiently and preventing redundancy. </p>

 	<p>
 	Take into condieration, the following chunk of code featuring an if conditional...</p>

 	<textarea>
 	var noLoopInput = prompt("How many times do you want to loop between 1 and 3?");

 	if (noLoopInput == 1) {
 		console.log("Got it.");
 	} else if (noLoopInput == 3) {
 		console.log("Got it.");
 		console.log("Got it.");
 		console.log("Got it.");
 	} else {
 		console.log("Please pick a number between 1 and 3.");
	}
 	</textarea>


	<p>The if conditional above is very inefficient. It is self-limiting to the number 3, and does not take into account the user;s desire to sometimes loop or perform some action many more times.</p>

	<p>Below is a for loop version of the above code that allows the user to loop as many times as they want.</p>

	<textare>
	var loopInput = prompt("How many times would you like to loop?");

	for (var i = 0; i < loopInput; i++) {
		console.log("Got it.");
	}
	</textarea>


<h2>For Loops</h1>

	<p>For loops are the most common type of loops in programming. The for loop is used to run a code block a certain number of times that is usually defined by the programmer or the user.</p>

	<p>Below is a pseudo-code example of how to write for a loop that works for almost all languages.</p>

	<textarea>
	for [initialization]; [condition]; [iteration] {
		[code block to perform an action];
	}
	</textarea>

	<p>In the above for loop pseudo-code, the following components are present...</p>

	<p>initialization = a blank variable created to tell the loop to start counting at a specified number. </p>

	<p>condition = a situation for the loop to compare the initialization to. Usually the condition tells the loop how many times it should run.</p>

	<p>iteration = by how many numbers the loop should count up or down using (ex. count up by 1s, count up by 3s, etc.)</p>

	<p><span class="count-up"></span></p>
	<p>Counting down...</p>
	<p><span class="count-down"></span></p>
	<p>Counting up by 10 to 100...</p>
	<p><span class="count-by-ten"></span></p>

<h1>Iterating through Arrays</h1>

	<p>It is not normally possible to manipulate how an array is displayed without using loops to control the output.</p>

	<p><span class="breakfast-array"></span></p>

<h2>While Loops</h2>

	<p>While loops state that while something is true, the loop will continue to run until that something is no longer true. Typically a while loop is used when you do not have a variable to set up to initialize.</p>

	<textare>
	while [condition] {
	[do something while the above is true];
	[iterator];
}
	</textarea>

	<p>While loops are terminated or ended by using some kind of iterator inside of its code block. </p>
	<p><span class="while-loop"></span></p>

<h2>Do While Loop</h2>

	<p>Do While Loops will always run at least once. They are a variable of the while loop, except they always execute first then evaluate or consider their condition.</p>

	<textarea>
		do {
		[iterator];
		[do something here];
	} while [condition];
	</textarea>

	<p><span class="do-while-loop"></span></p>
